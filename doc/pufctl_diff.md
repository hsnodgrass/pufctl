## pufctl diff

diff finds the difference between two Puppetfiles

### Synopsis


The pufctl diff command compares Puppetfiles at the parsed object level to 
find differences in them. You must supply the path to at least one Puppetfile.
If only one Puppetfile is specified, the configured default Puppetfile will
be used as the first Puppetfile in the comparison.

Meaningful exit codes have been added to the diff command to assist with
programatic implementations of this command (such as use in CI/CD systems).

Exit Codes:

0: No difference between the Puppetfiles

3: Only the first Puppetfile has differences

4: Only the second Puppetfile has differences

5: Differences in both Puppetfiles
